# Custom shell

## Summary

A minimal shell (like bash or zsh) that supports jobs, pipelines, signals (Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Z), and foreground/background process handling.

## Description

This program is a basic Unix-like shell that:

- Reads commands from the user (`fgets`)
- Parses them into commands and arguments
- Handles built-in commands like `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, `quit`, `help`
- Executes other commands by forking and `execvp`
- Supports pipelines (`|`) for connecting commands
- Tracks running processes as "jobs" with states:
  - Foreground (FG)
  - Background (BG)
  - Stopped (via `Ctrl+Z` â†’ `SIGTSTP`)
  - Default (not active)

- Handles signals:
  - `SIGINT` (`Ctrl+C`) to kill foreground processes
  - `SIGTSTP` (`Ctrl+Z`) to stop foreground processes
  - `SIGCHLD` to track when children exit or stop.
